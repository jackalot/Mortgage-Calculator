	This formula is for Standard fixed-rate loans.

	interest rate (r)
	number of years (t)
	payments per year (n)
	monthly income

		let t = document.getElementById("NumberOfYearsBox").value;
		let n = document.getElementById("PaymentsPerYearBox").value;
		// 					Half 1						Half 2
		//Payment = P x (r / n) x (1 + r / n)^n(t) / (1 + r / n)^n(t) - 1; Seperate this in two since JavaScript doesnt like math expressions.
		let Half1step1 = P * (r / n) * (1 + r / n);
		//console.log(Half1step1);
		let Half1 = Half1step1**n*t;

		console.log(Payment);
		document.getElementById("Replace").innerHTML = "Seperating the equation in parts gives us " + FullPayment + " but doing the equation all at once with what this language supports gives us " + Payment + " its probably wrong either way";

<p id="Replace">This is a really not working mortgage calculator by someone who doesnt know how to caclulate mortgage, with the formula used from https://www.thebalance.com/calculate-mortgage-315668 . Use the text boxes above to calculate it. Works with "Fixed loans" apparently.</p>
